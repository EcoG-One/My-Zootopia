# Zootopia

Just an exercise on my Python learning. It creates an HTML page using info 
fetched from api-ninjas.com.
The program asks the user to enter an animal family, (like dog, fox etc)
and then pooling information from the Animals API of api-ninjas.com,
generates the webpage "animals.html", based on the HTML template 
"animals_template.html". The page "animals.html" displays interesting 
scientific facts for the animals of the family entered by the user.
